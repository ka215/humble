# Sloth

Mobile First CSS Micro Framework. It has reduced styling coding costs to a minimum with non-BEM and simpler naming conventions than OOCSS.

## Why Sloth?

We're tired of complicating the HTML hierarchy to apply the preferred style and marking up several class names broken up into features. CSS should be simpler and better. This framework was developed for those who want to shirk neglect one's duties.
